# Halo: Intangible Triumph
## What Is This? 

Halo: Intangible Triumph was a top-down shooter I created using Game Maker in 2007-8 (first year high-school). It was pretty basic, but was my first big programming-based project - and I had a fun time putting it together. 

As with all things, I stopped working on it eventually, and the project sat somewhere on disk gathering dust. As Windows Vista rolled around the Game-Maker generated .exe files stopped working, so I was no longer able to open the copies I had. 

I recently came across a back-up copy of the source files, and thought it would be a fun project to get the game up and running again. It's not a game anyone would have any interest in playing, but I've often wished I still had a working copy - so that's the goal here.

And yes, I know it's a stupid name - I was 13. Leave me alone!

## Plan

- [x] Figure out which source file is most recent
- [x] Open that source file in GM 6.1 and confirm that it works
- [x] Make minimum necessary changes to run project in GM 8
- [x] Generate a working .exe from GM 8 that will run post-Vista (done, see [releases](https://github.com/chrissbarr/HaloIT/releases/))
- [x] Use GameMaker:Studio to import the GM 8 version and convert to a folder-based project structure instead of the GM 6.1 / 8 binary-blob (so I can actually see the code and track changes)
- [x] Get the project running in GM:S with the minimum number of necessary changes
- [x] Generate Windows and HTML5 runnables from GM:S (done, see [releases](https://github.com/chrissbarr/HaloIT/releases/))

Once I have the file/folder-based version of the project from GM:S in source-control, and have generated playable .exe and HTML5 outputs, I have a browsable and playable representation of the project as I left it years ago. 

Looking at the code, a lot of it is as ugly as anything (I had virtually no understanding of object-oriented programming) and I would love to tidy it up, but I would like to get as close to an unmodified version as possible working first, to serve as an honest indicator of my prior (embarrasing) programming effort.

## Playables
Now that playable files have been generated, they are being hosted on the [releases](https://github.com/chrissbarr/HaloIT/releases/) page.

Additionally, a browser-playable HTML5 copy of the most recent release is available [here](http://games.chrisbarrbuilds.com/HaloIT_latest/).
